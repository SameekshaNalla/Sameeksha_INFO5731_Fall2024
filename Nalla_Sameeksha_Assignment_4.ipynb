The evaluation of TF–IDF against contextual embeddings in BERTopic and LSA and BERTopic modifications showed that the selection of representations affects the quality and coherence of extracted topics. The comparison between traditional bag-of-words models and modern embedding models enabled me to better understand NLP concepts while demonstrating how semantic information develops in natural language processing.\n",

The kernel forced me to restart because the long processing time and non-responsive progress indicators led me to modify batch sizes and optimize the code until I achieved functional results. The process of parameter optimization for clustering and model interpretation evaluation proved difficult because of performance problems. The solution process showed me how modern NLP operations work in detail while demonstrating the need for developers to enhance model performance within hardware constraints.\n",

The assignment demonstrated that NLP needs three fundamental components which consist of data preprocessing and embedding choice and dimensionality reduction and model interpretability. The practical experience I obtained helped me understand how different topic modeling approaches function and their advantages and limitations for natural language processing applications.\n"
